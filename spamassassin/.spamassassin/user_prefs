# Add your own customised scores for some tests below.  The default scores are
# read from the installed spamassassin rules files, but you can override them
# here.  To see the list of tests and their default scores, go to
# http://spamassassin.apache.org/tests.html .
#
# score SYMBOLIC_TEST_NAME n.nn

# Speakers of Asian languages, like Chinese, Japanese and Korean, will almost
# definitely want to uncomment the following lines.  They will switch off some
# rules that detect 8-bit characters, which commonly trigger on mails using CJK
# character sets, or that assume a western-style charset is in use. 
# 
# score HTML_COMMENT_8BITS	0
# score UPPERCASE_25_50		0
# score UPPERCASE_50_75		0
# score UPPERCASE_75_100	0
# score OBSCURED_EMAIL          0

# Speakers of any language that uses non-English, accented characters may wish
# to uncomment the following lines.   They turn off rules that fire on
# misformatted messages generated by common mail apps in contravention of the
# email RFCs.

# score SUBJ_ILLEGAL_CHARS      0

#   Some shortcircuiting, if the plugin is enabled

#   default: strongly-whitelisted mails are *really* whitelisted now, if the
#   shortcircuiting plugin is active, causing early exit to save CPU load.
#   Uncomment to turn this on

# shortcircuit USER_IN_DEF_WHITELIST   on
# shortcircuit USER_IN_ALL_SPAM_TO     on

#   the opposite; blacklisted mails can also save CPU
#
# shortcircuit USER_IN_BLACKLIST       on
# shortcircuit USER_IN_BLACKLIST_TO    on
# shortcircuit SUBJECT_IN_BLACKLIST    on

#   if you have taken the time to correctly specify your "trusted_networks",
#   this is another good way to save CPU
#
# shortcircuit ALL_TRUSTED             on

#   and a well-trained bayes DB can save running rules, too
