# About

Config files for various tools I use, such as
[git](http://git-scm.com/),
[bash](http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html) and
[vim](http://www.vim.com/).
It's very unlikely that anyone will want to use this directly; the more
interesting directories are:

* [bashrc](bashrc) - configuration and startup files for bash shell.
* [bash/aliases](bash-aliases) - my personal aliases.
* [gitconfig](gitconfig) - add slightly more sophisticated shortcuts for git
  commands. These aliases are to be used together with `command_not_found()`
  function in my [bashrc/aliases](bashrc/aliases) (last section: functions).
* [vim/vimrc_mappings](vim-mappings) - all of my customized vim keybinds.

The actual filenames don't include the leading dot. This is for visibility and
it's slightly more convenient managing the files with git that way. In case you
find any issues I'd be happy you get in contact at :octocat:
