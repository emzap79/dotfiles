dotfiles
========

This repository serves as backup for personal use. Feel free to clone or
taking over parts of my configuration files! The actual filenames don't
include the leading dot. This is for visibility and it's slightly more
convenient managing the files with git that way. In case you find any
issues I'd be happy you get in contact... :octocat:
